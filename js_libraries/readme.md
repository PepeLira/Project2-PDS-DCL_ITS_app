# CAD JS (Version 0.6) - Pure Javascript 2D CAD drawing program
This project is no longer being worked on.

Try it here: https://tmjohnst.github.io/JSCAD/

This application uses pure JS to allow for 2D CAD drawing. It was created not to solve problems with existing programs, but as an exercise in using nothing but pure Javascript to accomplish something useful. Some items are needless use of Canvas drawing, such as vertexes, icons, and the UI. Those are intended as placeholders.

## Using CAD JS
Most tools are built to be self-explanatory with the exception of the selector tool. The selector selects and unselects vertexes as expected, but to move the selected vertexes CTRL must be held.

Holding CTRL activates the "secondary" function of any tool you're using, if it exists. Your cursor will change to a red PLUS (placeholder).

Shift is used to add more vertexes to the current selection set.
